Before you can start you need to install the following software packages:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (at least version 3.10)
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (at least version 1.61)

Both are also available as packages on many Linux distributions, e.g.:
- Debian/Ubuntu: apt install cmake libboost-dev
- Fedora: dnf install cmake boost

Afterwards, in the main project directory, type

./compile_withcmake.sh

Once you did that you can try to run the following command:

./build/reachability ./examples/arXiv.metis
